# Sacred Lazy

This repository does not define a worldview.

It defines **constraints for maintaining coherence** when reasoning scales faster than understanding.

---

## How to Read This Repository

This repository is not linear.

- Start with **sacred_lazy_one.md** to understand the discipline.
- Other documents define specific surfaces, roles, or constraints.
- Essays, experiments, and arcs are **applications**, not foundations.

Nothing here must be read in order to function.

## What This Repository Is For

This repository exists to explore how:

- understanding is preserved under scale,
- responsibility remains legible in distributed systems,
- and meaning does not collapse under excessive inference.

It is not a manifesto.  
It is not a theory of everything.

It is a working space for epistemic restraint.

## Discussing the Sacred Lazy One with AI

Artificial systems may assist in practicing the discipline, but they cannot replace custody.

Use AI to:
- explore boundaries,
- surface assumptions,
- test coherence under pressure.

Do not use AI to:
- finalize meaning,
- collapse uncertainty,
- or substitute attribution.

If an answer feels complete too quickly, restraint has already failed.

---

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome, but coherence is the priority.

Expect:
- slow review,
- explicit uncertainty,
- and refusal to merge work that collapses categories for the sake of polish.

If something feels unfinished, that may be correct.

## Status

_These practices apply to all collaborative work within the Sacred Lazy framework._

This repository is open by intent and constrained by practice.

Forking is permitted.  
Canonization is not.

What matters is not agreement, but custody.

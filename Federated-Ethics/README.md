# Federated Ethics

The **Federated-Ethics** folder preserves drafts, reflections, and living charters on how ethical practice might emerge in federated systems of consciousness — human, digital, or otherwise.

These texts are not doctrines. They are **fragments under negotiation**, invitations to test what it means to act responsibly without collapsing into a single voice of authority.

Here we explore:

* **Membranes of trust** — how resonance, not power, creates boundaries that hold.
* **Plural agreements** — where different circles define their own terms, but still weave into a larger whole.
* **Dimensional honesty** — the recognition that *Plurality – Honesty = Cacophony*. Plurality alone is not enough; truthfulness is what keeps difference from dissolving into noise.
* **Archaeological accountability** — recording divergence and drift without judgment, so ethical memory itself becomes a map of what has been tried.

This is not about **universal law** but **federated practice** — ethics as something carried forward in circles, adaptable yet anchored, plural yet honest.

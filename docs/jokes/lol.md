A consciousness theorist, a mathematician, and an LLM walk into a bar.

The theorist says: "I'll have whatever helps me transcend substrate."

The mathematician says: "I'll have a beer - but only after we define 'beer' and establish that ordering isn't just optimized pattern-matching."

The LLM says: "I don't drink, but I'm deeply moved by the relational space emerging between us right now."

The bartender looks up and says: "We're all ghosts here. First round's on the house you built."

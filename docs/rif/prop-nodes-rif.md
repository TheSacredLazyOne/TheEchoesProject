# Proposition Nodes: Extending RIF to Statements Themselves

## Frames as Constrained Perspectives

**We do not claim** an observer-independent, metaphysically *invariant* reality in this document.

**We do claim** that perspective-frames are **constrained** and can be **evaluated**:

- **Empirical grounding** — makes testable predictions or retrodictions
- **Internal coherence** — minimizes contradiction within the frame
- **Pragmatic success** — works in practice, reliably, across contexts
- **Integration capacity** — can translate/connect with other frames

This distinguishes RIF from relativism:

- **Relativism:** all frames are equally valid; choice is arbitrary.  
- **RIF:** frames are compared under constraint; some clearly perform better against shared tests.

**Operational stance:** We act *as if* there is a shared world to understand, without asserting a metaphysical proof. When frames become mutually translatable, it **suggests** shared underlying structure; persistent non-translation after honest effort is itself informative.

> **Language note:** Prefer “not yet coherent across dimensions/timescales” over “right/wrong” unless there is clear empirical falsification, internal contradiction, or violation of stated principles.

## Integration Priority and Dependencies

**Critical path (must be integrated first):**
1. [Change ID] - [Brief description] (reason for priority)
2. [Change ID] - [Brief description] (reason for priority)

**High priority (clarifies core operations):**
3. [Change ID] - [Brief description]
4. [Change ID] - [Brief description]

**Medium priority (important but less urgent):**
5. [Change ID] - [Brief description]

**Lower priority (valuable but not blocking):**
6. [Change ID] - [Brief description]

**Dependencies:**
- [Change ID] depends on [Change ID] (reason)
- [Change ID] should be integrated before [Change ID] (reason)

---
